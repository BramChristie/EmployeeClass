# Employee Class

Use smartdraw again to make a UML class diagram for an Employee class. The requirements for the class are as follows:

### Data Fields:
- Employee name
- Department
- Position
- Salary
- Years employed
### Constructors:
- Default
- Overloaded (This could be one or more)
### Methods:
- Getters
- Setters

Write the Java code to create the Employee class. Then, write a Main.java program that does the following:
- Instantiates an Employee object
- Checks to see if the employee is a member of the “Tech Department”
- Checks to see if the employee has been employed 5 years or more
- If both cases are true, the program should give the employee a 5% raise
- Print the employee’s previous salary and the new salary.
- The salary data field should be updated to reflect the increase.

Upload your UML diagram image and include it with your submission.
